# Project-5-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
Data Science Bootcamp @WBS Coding School


Pretty straightforward approach towards this whole topic, will add the Link to the related article here later.
As mentioned in our learning platform we did 3 notebooks, the first doing the "data preperation", outputting .csv files for the variously-scaled datasets.
These get loaded in "cluster exploration", transformed und clustered and later sampled in the "Modelling" notebook, mostly manually for now.
Can do a lot of iterative exploring in the 2nd notebook, as well as way more plots on the different relations between columns.
