## Fifth project of the Data Science Bootcamp @WBS Coding School
### Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering songs for playlists


Pretty straightforward approach towards this whole topic, since there was a ton to learn and read about.
* Euclidean vs Manhattan distances
* An introduction into the Sklearn module
* Various scaler and transformers
* Inertia and silhouette scores
* Clustering with KMeans
As suggested in our learning platform I did 3 notebooks, the first doing the "data preperation", outputting .csv files for the variously-scaled datasets.
These get loaded in "cluster exploration", transformed und clustered and later sampled in the "Modelling" notebook, mostly manually for now.
Can do a lot of iterative exploring in the 2nd notebook, as well as way more plots on the different relations between columns.
Added a "Dump Folder" to keep a bit track of what my colleagues did as well ;)
